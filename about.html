      <h2>Psychotherapy or Coaching? Which Path Feels Right for You?</h2>
      <p>Life can throw challenges our way, and not everyone needs psychotherapy or counselling to navigate them. Sometimes, especially when you're focused on career goals, personal growth, or finding clarity, coaching can be the perfect fit.</p>

      <p>Both Psychotherapy and Coaching are wonderful ways to support your well-being, build emotional strength, and boost your confidence. While they share some similarities, they each have a unique focus.</p>

      <p><strong>Psychotherapy and counselling</strong> are aimed at supporting you through mental health concerns or emotional difficulties. They help address psychological challenges, healing wounds, and restoring balance in your life.</p>

      <p><strong>Coaching</strong>, on the other hand, is forward-looking and goal-oriented. It’s about helping you move through life’s transitions, build resilience, and create the future you want — whether that’s in your career, relationships, or self-confidence.</p>

      <p>Curious to learn more? Take a look at both options and see which feels like the right step on your journey. Whatever you choose, the most important thing is that you’re taking time to care for yourself.</p>
