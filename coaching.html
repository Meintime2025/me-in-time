    <h1>Coaching with Me In Time</h1>
    <p>Coaching is a chance to step back from the noise and reconnect with what matters to you. Whether youâ€™re facing a career crossroads, navigating life transitions, or simply feeling stuck, this is a space for clarity, confidence, and change â€” grounded in real conversation, not quick fixes.</p>

    <p>Together, weâ€™ll look at whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s not, and where youâ€™d like to go next. Itâ€™s not always easy to do that alone â€” and having someone beside you can make all the difference. Iâ€™ll help you identify new opportunities, recognise your strengths, and reconnect with what brings you energy, meaning, and a sense of direction.</p>

    <h2>Why Work with Me?</h2>
    <p>Before becoming a therapist, I spent many years leading, mentoring, and coaching people across different sectors. I hold formal qualifications in coaching and mentoring, and Iâ€™ve worked with individuals in frontline, creative, and leadership roles. I also bring lived experience, empathy, and a deep respect for the courage it takes to ask, <em>what now?</em></p>

    <p>My approach is practical, thoughtful, and person-centred. I wonâ€™t push you to be someone youâ€™re not â€” instead, Iâ€™ll support you to make grounded, intentional changes that feel right for you.</p>

    <h2>What Coaching Can Help With</h2>
    <p>Coaching can support you in a range of areas, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Career reflection and change</li>
      <li>Rebuilding confidence and motivation</li>
      <li>Navigating life transitions</li>
      <li>Exploring identity, values, and purpose</li>
      <li>Managing overwhelm and decision-making</li>
      <li>Menâ€™s mental health and personal growth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Sessions are held online via Google Meet. You donâ€™t need to prepare anything â€” just bring yourself and whatever feels important to explore. Weâ€™ll work at your pace, using honest conversation, gentle reflection, and practical steps to support your growth.</p>

    <p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Â£60 per session</li>
      <li>Â£25 concessionary rate (subject to availability)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>If this feels like what youâ€™re looking for, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. You can reach out via <a href="mailto:stuart.meintime@gmail.com" title="Email Stuart Walker">email</a> to arrange a free, no-pressure chat.</p>
    <p>And if Iâ€™m not the right fit, thatâ€™s okay â€” Iâ€™m happy to signpost you to someone who might be.</p>
