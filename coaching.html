    <h1>Coaching with Me In Time</h1>

    <p><strong>A quiet shift in direction.</strong><br>
    Sometimes itâ€™s not about going faster â€” itâ€™s about finding the right track. Coaching can help you reconnect with what matters and move forward with purpose.</p>

    <p>Whether youâ€™re facing a career crossroads, navigating a life transition, or just feeling stuck, this is a space to pause, reflect, and begin again â€” at your own pace. Like a tram winding through the early-morning city, coaching offers a steady, focused route through uncertainty.</p>

    <p>You donâ€™t need to have all the answers. Together, weâ€™ll look at whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s not, and where youâ€™d like to go next. Iâ€™ll support you to identify new possibilities, recognise your strengths, and move with more confidence and clarity â€” in your own way.</p>

  <h2>Why Work with Me?</h2>
  <p>Before becoming a therapist, I spent many years leading, mentoring, and coaching people across a range of roles and sectors. I hold formal qualifications in coaching and mentoring, and Iâ€™ve supported individuals working in frontline, creative, and leadership positions.</p>

  <p>I also bring lived experience â€” and a deep respect for the courage it takes to ask, <em>what now?</em></p>

  <p>My approach is practical, thoughtful, and person-centred. I wonâ€™t push you to become someone youâ€™re not. Instead, Iâ€™ll help you make grounded, intentional shifts that feel true to who you are.</p>

  <h2>What Coaching Can Help With</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Career reflection and change</li>
    <li>Rebuilding confidence and motivation</li>
    <li>Navigating life transitions</li>
    <li>Exploring identity, values, and purpose</li>
    <li>Managing overwhelm and decision-making</li>
    <li>Menâ€™s mental health and personal growth</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Sessions take place online via Google Meet. You donâ€™t need to prepare anything â€” just bring yourself, and whatever feels important to explore.</p>

  <p>Weâ€™ll work together in a way thatâ€™s honest, collaborative, and attuned to your pace â€” using reflective conversation and practical steps to support your growth.</p>

  <h2>Pricing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Â£60 per session</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Â£25 concessionary rate</strong> (subject to availability)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>If this sounds like the kind of support youâ€™re looking for, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
  <p>Feel free to get in touch to arrange a free, no-pressure chat. And if Iâ€™m not the right fit, thatâ€™s okay â€” Iâ€™m happy to signpost you to someone who might be.</p>
