<h1>Coaching</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Support for When Youâ€™re Feeling Stuck, Lost, or Ready for Change</h2>
  <p>Sometimes, itâ€™s not therapy thatâ€™s needed â€” itâ€™s a space to reflect, refocus, and move forward with clarity. Coaching offers time and structure to help you reconnect with what matters and take practical steps toward where you want to be.</p>

  <h3>Why Work With Me</h3>
  <p>Before becoming a psychotherapist, I spent many years in leadership and coaching roles across different industries â€” mentoring individuals, managing teams, and supporting people through life transitions. I saw how much people benefit from honest, grounded support.</p>
  <p>That experience now shapes the way I work as a coach. I understand the blocks that can show up â€” low confidence, career fatigue, self-doubt, overwhelm â€” and I know how powerful it can be to have someone alongside you who listens, reflects, and helps you get moving again.</p>
  <p>Coaching with me is practical and person-centred. Itâ€™s not about having all the answers â€” itâ€™s about discovering yours.</p>

  <h3>What Coaching Can Help With</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Feeling stuck or lost in life</li>
    <li>Navigating change or transition</li>
    <li>Career reflection or job dissatisfaction</li>
    <li>Confidence, motivation, and self-belief</li>
    <li>Menâ€™s mental health and identity work</li>
    <li>Reconnecting with what matters to you</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Approach</h3>
  <p>This is a space for honest conversation, reflection, and real progress â€” at your pace. Coaching with me blends my background in leadership and mentoring with deep listening, challenge when needed, and a strong belief in your potential.</p>
  <p>Sessions are held online via Google Meet and follow the same pricing as counselling:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Â£60 per session</li>
    <li>Â£25 concessionary rate (subject to availability)</li>
  </ul>
