        <p><strong>Finding Clarity and Moving Forward</strong></p>
      </header>

      <p>Sometimes life feels stuck — whether it's uncertainty about your next steps, low confidence, or feeling overwhelmed by change. Coaching offers a practical, supportive space to reflect, refocus, and take clear, manageable steps toward what matters most to you.</p>

      <h2>Why Coaching with Me?</h2>
      <p>Before becoming a psychotherapist, I spent many years in leadership, coaching, and mentoring roles across various industries. I hold formal qualifications in coaching and mentoring, which complement my practical experience. I’ve also had the privilege of mentoring with Mind, supporting individuals navigating mental health challenges.</p>
      <p>My coaching approach blends that experience with empathy and deep listening. I understand the blocks that can show up — self-doubt, career fatigue, motivation struggles — and I’m here to help you explore what’s holding you back and find your own way forward.</p>

      <h2>What Coaching Can Help With</h2>
      <p>Coaching can support you if you’re feeling stuck, facing life transitions, needing career reflection, building confidence and motivation, exploring men’s mental health and identity, or reconnecting with what really matters.</p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>Coaching with me is practical and person-centred. It’s not about having all the answers — it’s about discovering yours. We’ll work together at your pace, with honest conversations, gentle challenges when needed, and clear actions to help you move forward.</p>

      <p>Sessions are held online via Google Meet and follow the same pricing as counselling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>£60 per session</li>
        <li>£25 concessionary rate (subject to availability)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>If this feels like what you’re looking for, I’d love to hear from you. You can reach out via <a href="mailto:stuart.meintime@gmail.com" title="Email Stuart Walker">email</a> or the <a href="contact.html" title="Contact form" class="button-link">contact form</a> to arrange a free, no-pressure chat.</p>

      <p>And if I’m not the right fit, that’s okay — I’m happy to signpost you to someone who might be.</p>
