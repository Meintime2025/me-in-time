<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<details>
  <summary>How do I book a session?</summary>
  <p>You can book easily by filling out the contact form on this site, sending me an email, giving me a call, or even messaging via social media. I’ll get back to you quickly to find a time that fits your life.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What happens in the first session?</summary>
  <p>Our first meeting is just a gentle getting-to-know-you. There’s no pressure to share more than you want — it’s simply a chance to explore what brought you here and see if we feel like a good fit to work together.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How soon can I start?</summary>
  <p>Usually, I have availability within the week you reach out. I’m flexible with timings to help fit around your schedule, so we can get started as soon as you’re ready.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How long will counselling take?</summary>
  <p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people find a few sessions helpful; others benefit from longer-term support. We’ll review things together regularly, and you’re free to pause or stop whenever you feel it’s right.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
  <p>Sessions are £50 each, with a concessionary rate of £25 available for those who need it. Payment is usually made by bank transfer after each session.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What if I can’t afford therapy?</summary>
  <p>I understand therapy is an investment. If cost feels like a barrier, please talk to me. I offer a limited number of lower-cost spaces and can help guide you to other services if needed.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is therapy confidential?</summary>
  <p>Yes. Everything you share stays between us, with a few important exceptions like safeguarding concerns or legal requirements — which I’ll explain clearly upfront so you always feel safe.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What kinds of issues do you work with?</summary>
  <p>I support people through many challenges, including anxiety, depression, grief, trauma, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties, identity questions, and men’s mental health. If you’re unsure, just ask — I’m happy to chat.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to prepare or bring anything to sessions?</summary>
  <p>No special preparation is needed. Just bring yourself and we’ll take things at a pace that feels comfortable for you.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I know if therapy is right for me?</summary>
  <p>Many people feel unsure at first. The best way is to try a session and see how it feels. There’s no pressure to continue if it doesn’t feel right — this is your journey.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What if I don’t feel comfortable?</summary>
  <p>Feeling safe and heard is key. If something doesn’t feel right, please let me know. Sometimes I might not be the best fit, and that’s okay — I’ll help you find someone who is.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can sessions be held online or in person?</summary>
  <p>Yes, I offer both online and in-person sessions depending on your preference and availability. We can decide what works best for you.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What’s your cancellation policy?</summary>
  <p>I ask for at least 48 hours’ notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. If notice is shorter, there may be a charge unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you work with men, LGBTQ+ or neurodivergent clients?</summary>
  <p>Absolutely. My practice welcomes and supports people of all genders, identities, and backgrounds. I aim to create a safe, respectful space where everyone feels seen.</p>
