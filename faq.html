    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <section class="faq">
      <details><summary>How do I book a session?</summary>
        <p>You can book online via the tab below, or get in touch by email, phone, the contact form at the bottom of this page, or through social media. Weâ€™ll then arrange an initial sessionâ€”either in person, by phone, or online.</p>
        <p><a href="contact.html" class="button-link">Contact me.</a></p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>What happens in the first session?</summary>
        <p>The initial session is a chance for us to get to know each other and explore how we might work together. Thereâ€™s no obligation to continue, and I always encourage clients to find the therapist who feels like the right fit.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>How soon can I start?</summary>
        <p>I usually have availability within the same week you're in touch, and I offer flexible appointment times to suit your schedule.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>How long will counselling take?</summary>
        <p>Thereâ€™s no fixed number of sessions. Some people come for just a few sessions, others longer term. We might start with six and review together as we go. Itâ€™s always your choiceâ€”and youâ€™re free to pause or stop at any time.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
        <p>Sessions cost Â£60. A concessionary rate of Â£25 is available for those who need it. Payment is usually made by bank transfer after each session.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>How long are sessions and how often will we meet?</summary>
        <p>Sessions are 50 minutes long. Most people come weekly, but we can agree together on what works best for you â€” some prefer fortnightly or a more flexible arrangement.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>What if I canâ€™t afford therapy?</summary>
        <p>If cost is a barrier, please talk to me. I offer a limited number of reduced-rate sessions and may be able to signpost alternative services.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>Is therapy confidential?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Everything shared is confidential, with a few legal/ethical exceptions (e.g. risk of harm). I explain these fully in our first session.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>What kinds of issues do you work with?</summary>
        <p>I support a range of concerns including anxiety, grief, trauma, low self-worth, identity, and menâ€™s mental health. Please reach out if unsure.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>Do I need to prepare or bring anything to sessions?</summary>
        <p>Just bring yourself. There's no need to prepare unless you'd like to. Sessions are guided by what feels most helpful to you.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>What if I donâ€™t feel comfortable?</summary>
        <p>Therapy should feel safe. If anything doesnâ€™t feel right, we can talk about it. Iâ€™m also happy to help you find another therapist if needed.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>Can sessions be held online or in person?</summary>
        <p>I offer both options depending on availability and your preferences. Letâ€™s discuss what suits you best.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>Whatâ€™s your cancellation policy?</summary>
        <p>48 hoursâ€™ notice is appreciated. Late cancellations may be charged unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
      </details>

      <details><summary>Do you work with men, LGBTQ+, or neurodivergent clients?</summary>
        <p>Yes. My practice is inclusive and open to people of all identities and backgrounds. I strive to create a safe, respectful environment.</p>
