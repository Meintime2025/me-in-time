  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <details>
    <summary>1. How do I book a session?</summary>
    <p>You can get in touch via email, phone, the contact form, or through social media. Weâ€™ll then arrange an initial sessionâ€”online or in personâ€”at a time that works for you.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>2. What happens in the first session?</summary>
    <p>Itâ€™s a chance for us to meet, talk through whatâ€™s brought you here, and explore how we might work together. Thereâ€™s no pressure and no obligation to continue if it doesnâ€™t feel right.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>3. How much does it cost?</summary>
    <p>Sessions are Â£60. I also have some spaces set aside for lower-cost sessions. If money feels like a barrier, please ask â€” we can talk about it.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>4. How many sessions will I need?</summary>
    <p>Thatâ€™s different for everyone. Some people come for just a few sessions, others longer term. Weâ€™ll check in regularly to see how itâ€™s going and you can stop, pause, or continue at any time.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>5. Are sessions confidential?</summary>
    <p>Yes. What you share stays between us, with a few legal and ethical exceptions. Iâ€™ll explain all of this clearly in our first session so you feel safe and informed.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>6. Do you work with men, LGBTQ+, and neurodivergent clients?</summary>
    <p>Absolutely. My practice is inclusive and welcoming to people of all genders, backgrounds, and identities. I aim to create a space where you feel safe, seen, and respected.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>7. Is therapy right for me?</summary>
    <p>Many people feel unsure at first. You donâ€™t have to have everything figured out â€” therapy can help you make sense of things. The best way to know is to try a session and see how it feels.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>8. What can I bring to therapy?</summary>
    <p>Just yourself. No need to prepare anything. Youâ€™re welcome exactly as you are, and weâ€™ll go at a pace that feels manageable for you.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>9. What issues do you work with?</summary>
    <p>I work with a wide range of concerns â€” including anxiety, grief, loss, trauma, life transitions, identity, menâ€™s mental health, and low self-esteem. If youâ€™re unsure whether I can help, feel free to ask.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>10. Can we meet online or in person?</summary>
    <p>Yes. I offer both online and in-person sessions, depending on availability. We can talk about what suits you best.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>11. How often will we meet?</summary>
    <p>Most people come weekly, but we can agree what works best for you â€” fortnightly or flexible options are also possible.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>12. What if I canâ€™t afford therapy?</summary>
    <p>We can talk about it. I understand therapy is a big commitment â€” if cost is a concern, please get in touch. I offer a limited number of low-cost sessions and may be able to suggest other options too.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>13. What if I donâ€™t feel comfortable?</summary>
    <p>Feeling safe and heard is key. If something doesnâ€™t feel right, I encourage you to share that. We can talk about it â€” and if Iâ€™m not the right fit, Iâ€™ll do my best to help you find someone who is.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>14. Whatâ€™s your cancellation policy?</summary>
    <p>I ask for 48 hoursâ€™ notice to cancel or reschedule. Cancellations with less notice may be charged in full, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
