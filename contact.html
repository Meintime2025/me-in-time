      <h2>Privacy, Ethics & Safety</h2>

      <p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p>
      <p>When you're reaching out for support — especially when life feels uncertain — it's important to know you're in safe hands. I take your trust seriously. That’s why I follow recognised ethical standards, am registered with relevant bodies, and have the experience to hold a safe, respectful space for you.</p>

      <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-us/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="contact-button translucent-button">📘 Contact The BACP</a>
      <p>I’m a registered member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy). This means I work within a professional ethical framework focused on your safety, autonomy, and wellbeing.</p>
