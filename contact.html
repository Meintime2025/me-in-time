      <h2>Privacy, Ethics & Safety</h2>

      <p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p>
      <p>When you're reaching out for support â€” especially when life feels uncertain â€” it's important to know you're in safe hands. I take your trust seriously. Thatâ€™s why I follow recognised ethical standards, am registered with relevant bodies, and have the experience to hold a safe, respectful space for you.</p>

         ðŸ“˜ Contact The BACP
      </a>
      <p>Iâ€™m a registered member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy). This means I work within a professional ethical framework focused on your safety, autonomy, and wellbeing.</p>
