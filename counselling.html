        <h1>Counselling with Me In Time</h1>
        <p>Sometimes we just need space â€” to breathe, to speak freely, and to feel truly heard. Counselling offers that space. Whether youâ€™re navigating a specific challenge or holding something harder to name, this is time set aside for you: to explore, reflect, and begin to make sense of things at your own pace.</p>

      <h2>A Calm, Grounded Approach</h2>
      <p>I work integratively, drawing from a range of therapeutic approaches, but my work is always rooted in a person-centred foundation. That means we begin where you are â€” with no assumptions, no pressure, and no rush. I wonâ€™t diagnose or analyse you from a distance. Instead, weâ€™ll build understanding together, in a relationship based on trust, safety, and respect.</p>

      <h2>Some of the Things We Might Explore</h2>
      <p>People come to therapy for all sorts of reasons, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeling anxious, low, or overwhelmed</li>
        <li>Grief and loss</li>
        <li>Low self-esteem or a harsh inner critic</li>
        <li>Relationship difficulties</li>
        <li>Questions around identity, purpose, or direction</li>
        <li>Menâ€™s mental health and the things that often go unsaid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But you donâ€™t need a crisis â€” or a clear label â€” to begin. Just a sense that now might be the right time to talk.</p>

      <h2>Practicalities</h2>
      <p>Sessions last 50 minutes and are usually held weekly (though fortnightly can be arranged if that suits you better). I offer both in-person and online appointments.</p>
      <p><strong>Fee:</strong> Â£60 per session. A limited number of lower-cost spaces are available â€” please ask if this would help.</p>

      <p>If youâ€™d like to arrange an initial session or simply talk things through, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
