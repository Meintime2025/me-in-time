    <p>Starting therapy for the first time—or returning after a difficult experience—can feel daunting. It’s common to carry fears about being misunderstood, judged, or not knowing what to expect. For many men, these feelings can be even harder to face, with pressures to appear strong and keep emotions private.</p>

    <p>At Me In Time, I understand these challenges deeply. I offer integrative online counselling designed to meet you where you are, with kindness and patience. This is a safe, non-judgmental space where your story matters, and you can explore your feelings at your own pace—without pressure or expectations.</p>

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>

    <h3>One-to-One Counselling</h3>
    <p>Weekly 50-minute sessions online, crafted to support you through your unique journey, whether it’s your first time or a fresh start after a tough experience.</p>

    <h3>Individual Work</h3>
    <p>Therapy can feel unfamiliar, but here you’ll find a confidential space to share openly, with someone who listens attentively and responds with empathy. Together, we’ll work to understand what’s happening for you, gently uncovering insights and building a foundation for healing.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Counselling and Psychotherapy</h2>
    <p>While counselling tends to focus on immediate challenges and practical support, psychotherapy often explores deeper patterns and longer-term change. I use an integrative approach, blending these methods and tailoring the work to what feels right for you.</p>
    <p>We can discuss these differences more fully during an introductory meeting to ensure the right approach for you.</p>

    <h2>Areas I Focus On</h2>
    <p>Grief and loss, men’s mental health, trauma, life transitions, relationships, self-esteem, and more. I know how difficult it can be to ask for help when you’ve been hurt or felt unheard before. Together, we’ll create a compassionate space where you can break the silence and start to heal.</p>

    <h2>Flexible Pricing</h2>
    <p>Sessions cost £60, with a concessionary rate of £25 available for those who need it. I’m happy to discuss what works best for your situation.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality & Ethics</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is respected completely. All sessions follow the ethical standards of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), with secure handling of your personal information under GDPR.</p>

    <h2>How We Work Together</h2>
    <p>I combine honesty, empathy, and practical support to create a welcoming space that helps you find clarity and take meaningful steps forward. I understand that reaching out is an act of courage—especially for men—and I’m here to meet you with respect, patience, and genuine care.</p>
