  <h1>Counselling Services</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Life can throw us curveballs—grief, anxiety, difficult transitions, or the silent struggles many men face but rarely speak about. At Me In Time, I offer integrative counselling tailored just for you. Whether you prefer to meet in person or online, I provide a warm, safe space where your story is honoured, and you can explore it at your own pace.</p>

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>

    <p>One-to-One Counselling</p>
    <p>Weekly 50-minute sessions, available in person or online, designed to support you wherever you are on your journey.</p>

    <h3>Individual Work</h3>
    <p>Individual counselling is often a good starting place for those new to psychotherapy. In a confidential setting, you can speak openly about the distress or disorientation you’re experiencing. I listen attentively and respond sensitively, helping you to understand your current challenges within the broader context of your life and history.</p>
    <p>One-to-one work can be an end in itself or a stepping stone towards joining a psychotherapy group, depending on what feels right for you.</p>

    <h3>Understanding Counselling and Psychotherapy</h3>
    <p>While counselling and psychotherapy share many similarities, psychotherapy often delves deeper into the roots of psychological difficulties, working with underlying patterns and longer-term change. Counselling typically focuses more on immediate concerns and practical support. My approach is integrative, meaning I tailor what’s best for you — whether that’s counselling, psychotherapy, or a blend of both.</p>

    <h3>Areas of Focus</h3>
    <p>Grief and loss, men’s mental health, trauma, life transitions, relationships, self-esteem, and more. I understand how men often carry emotional burdens quietly, sometimes feeling pressure to “keep it together.” My approach creates room to break that silence with compassion and understanding.</p>

    <h3>Flexible Pricing</h3>
    <p>Sessions cost <strong>£60</strong>, with a concessionary rate of <strong>£25</strong> available if you need it. I’m happy to discuss what works best for you.</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality & Ethics</h3>
    <p>Your privacy matters. All sessions are confidential and follow the ethical guidelines of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). Personal information is stored securely, fully compliant with GDPR.</p>

    <h3>How We Work Together</h3>
    <p>I combine honesty, empathy, and practical support, offering a non-judgmental space to help you find clarity and move forward meaningfully. I know how difficult it can be to ask for help, especially for men, so I’m here to meet you exactly where you are — with patience, respect, and genuine care.</p>
