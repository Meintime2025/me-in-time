    <h2>Not sure what’s right for you?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes life throws challenges at us, and not everyone needs counselling or psychotherapy to work through them. Especially when it’s about work, goals, or feeling stuck, coaching can often be a better fit.</p>
    <p>Both counselling and coaching help you feel stronger and more confident, but they do it in different ways.</p>
    <p>Think of counselling as a gentle space where you can unpack your emotions, heal old wounds, and better understand yourself — especially when life feels heavy or complicated.</p>
    <p>Coaching, on the other hand, is more like having a supportive guide who helps you figure out what you want next, build your confidence, and take practical steps toward your goals.</p>
    <p>If you’re wondering which might suit you, feel free to check out my <a href="counselling.html">Counselling</a> and <a href="coaching.html">Coaching</a> pages, or just <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> for a friendly, no-pressure chat.</p>
