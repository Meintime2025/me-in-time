      <h2>Is Therapy for You?</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks for being here. I know reaching out for support isn’t always easy — especially if you're used to carrying a lot, quietly. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, grieving, or just unsure of your next step, this is a space where all of that is welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therapy isn’t about having all the answers — it’s about giving yourself permission to ask the questions. You don’t need to have everything figured out. Just a willingness to be met where you are.

      <h2>Holding It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes we all feel like we have to be a superhero. Keep going. Stay strong. Push through. You might be the one others rely on — the quiet one, the capable one, the one who doesn’t complain.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you don’t have to hold everything on your own. Here, you can let go. Breathe. Be human — not heroic. This space is yours.

      <h2>A Safe Place to Bring It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        Me In Time is a grounded counselling and coaching practice. I offer a space that’s compassionate and honest — where there’s no pressure to “fix” anything, just a chance to explore what’s going on and what might help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s grief, change, anxiety, or just the need to talk without being judged, we can work through it — together, at your pace. You don’t have to go it alone.

    <h2>Why "Me In Time"?</h2>
    <p>
      The name comes from a simple idea: that healing and growth happen when we’re met as we are — not who we think we should be. Me In Time is about meeting yourself with honesty and kindness, even in the messy, uncertain moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a space where strength doesn’t have to mean silence. Where you don’t have to keep carrying it alone. If you’d like to know more or arrange a first chat, I’d be happy to hear from you.
