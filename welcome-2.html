      <h2>Is Therapy for You?</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks for being here. I know reaching out for support isnâ€™t always easy â€” especially if you're used to carrying a lot, quietly. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, grieving, or just unsure of your next step, this is a space where all of that is welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therapy isn't about being 'ill enough' or having everything figured out â€” it's about having the space to reflect, question, and be supported in that process. You donâ€™t need to know if itâ€™s right yet. Thatâ€™s why I offer a free, no-pressure introductory conversation â€” just a chance to ask anything and get a feel for whether this could be a good fit. Iâ€™d be happy to talk it through with you.

      <h2>Holding It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes we all feel like we have to be a superhero. Keep going. Stay strong. Push through. For many â€” especially men â€” there can be pressure to cope silently, to be the one who holds it together for everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        These quiet expectations can be exhausting. In this space, you donâ€™t need to perform or pretend. You donâ€™t have to suffer in silence. I understand how hard it can be to ask for help â€” but I also know how powerful it can be to take that step and be met with empathy, not judgment.

      <h2>A Safe Place to Bring It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        Finding a safe space to just be â€” without pressure, advice, or assumptions â€” can be difficult. My hope is that this space offers exactly that: time and space to be heard, to understand more about yourself, and to find what healing looks like for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Me In Time is a grounded counselling and coaching practice. You donâ€™t need to come with a plan. Sometimes, just talking things through makes all the difference. Whether youâ€™re navigating loss, change, stress, or something harder to name â€” we can explore it together, at your pace.

    <h2>Why "Me In Time"?</h2>
    <p>
      The name comes from a simple idea: that healing and growth happen when weâ€™re met as we are â€” not who we think we should be. Me In Time is about creating space to meet yourself with honesty, compassion, and patience â€” even in the messy, uncertain moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Itâ€™s a space where strength doesnâ€™t have to mean silence. Where therapy isnâ€™t about being fixed â€” but about being seen. If youâ€™d like to know more or arrange a first chat, Iâ€™d be happy to hear from you.
