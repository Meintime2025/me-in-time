    <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>
    <p>Thanks for being here. I know reaching out for support isn’t always easy — especially if you’re used to carrying a lot, quietly. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, grieving, or just unsure of your next step, this is a space where all of that is welcome.</p>

    <p>Me In Time is a grounded counselling and coaching practice that meets you where you are. There’s no pressure to “have it all together” here. Just a chance to talk, reflect, and begin to move forward — in your own way, at your own pace.</p>

    <h2>A Human, Relational Approach</h2>
    <p>I work integratively, with a person-centred heart. That means we’ll focus on what matters to you, building a safe, honest, and collaborative relationship. I bring a warm, reflective presence and aim to meet you with both compassion and clarity.</p>

    <p>Sometimes that means exploring past experiences that still linger. Sometimes it’s about navigating grief or change. Sometimes it’s about building confidence and clarity around what’s next. Whatever it is, we’ll explore it together.</p>

    <h2>Why "Me In Time"?</h2>
    <p>The name comes from a simple idea: that healing and growth happen when we’re met as we are, not who we think we should be. Me In Time is about meeting yourself with honesty and kindness — even in the messy, uncertain moments.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to know more or arrange a first chat, I’d be happy to hear from you.</p>
