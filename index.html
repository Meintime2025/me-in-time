      <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>
      <p>Me In Time started with a simple but often overlooked truth â€” that men need space too. Space to talk, reflect, and feel without pressure. For years, I saw how hard it can be for men to reach out, and how little space there is for honest, human support.</p>
      <p>This is a place to bring whateverâ€™s going on â€” whether itâ€™s stress, grief, feeling stuck, or not even knowing how to describe it. You donâ€™t need to have it all figured out. You donâ€™t need to be in crisis. You just need to start where you are.</p>
      <p>Although Me In Time began with a focus on menâ€™s mental health, I welcome anyone who connects with this way of working â€” calm, thoughtful, and grounded in real conversation.</p>

      <h2>Services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counselling:</strong> A calm, confidential space to gently explore whatâ€™s weighing on you â€” whether itâ€™s anxiety, grief, low self-worth, life transitions, or feelings that are hard to name. Thereâ€™s no pressure to explain everything all at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Coaching:</strong> A reflective, practical space to help you gain clarity, rebuild confidence, and move forward with intention â€” especially if you're at a crossroads or feeling unsure of your next steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible sessions:</strong> All sessions are held online, and I offer a small number of low-cost places. Weâ€™ll talk together about what feels right for you, at a pace that works for where you are.</li>
      </ul>
