      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Maybe you're feeling stuck. Maybe you’re holding more than you can manage on your own. Maybe something's shifted — or maybe nothing has, and that’s part of the problem.</p>
      <p>Whatever brings you here, Me In Time is a space to pause and take stock.</p>
      <p>I'm Stuart Walker — a counsellor who offers time, space, and presence for people navigating the difficult bits of life. My approach is warm, grounded, and human. I don’t offer quick fixes, and I won’t pretend to have all the answers. But I’ll meet you with honesty, care, and curiosity.</p>
      <p>I believe therapy is a conversation. It’s a place to explore things you might not say anywhere else. To be heard — without being judged or rushed. To remember your voice. To make space for whatever you’ve been carrying.</p>
      <p>This work isn’t about getting it right. It’s about giving yourself time — to make sense, to feel, to breathe, to be.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to know more about me or how I work, you’re very welcome to explore the site — or get in touch when you’re ready.</p>

    <section class="poem">
      <p>You sit down, shoulders hunched like guilt,</p>
      <p>Lips are already forming the words:<br>
      “Sorry — I don’t talk about this much.”</p>
      <p>And I nod, though inside I sigh.<br>
      Not at you.<br>
      At all the years that taught you<br>
      Your pain was something to preface.<br>
      To pad.<br>
      To apologise for.</p>
      <p>You’re not a burden.<br>
      You’re a person.<br>
      With a past.<br>
      A knot of thoughts you’ve carried<br>
      in silence,<br>
      afraid your story would take up too much space.</p>
      <p>I’ve heard it a hundred ways:<br>
      “I’m not good at this...”<br>
      “Don’t want to waste your time...”<br>
      “Sorry, it’s probably stupid...”<br>
      And my heart gets heavier<br>
      Not from what you say<br>
      But from all you felt you couldn’t.</p>
      <p>No one taught you<br>
      That grief has a right to speak<br>
      Even in your voice.</p>
      <p>So here’s what I wish I could tattoo on the moment:<br>
      You do not need permission<br>
      To feel.<br>
      To speak.<br>
      To be heard.</p>
      <p>No need to be polished.<br>
      No need to be strong.<br>
      No need to be sorry.</p>
      <p>Just begin.</p>
