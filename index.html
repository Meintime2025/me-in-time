    <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>

    <p>It’s good you’re here. Life can sometimes feel overwhelming or confusing, and maybe you’re carrying more than you can manage right now. Or perhaps you’re just curious, taking a moment to pause and see what support might look like for you.</p>

    <p>At Me In Time, you’ll find a warm, calm space where you’re invited to simply be yourself. I’m Stuart Walker, and my role is to listen, to hold space, and to walk alongside you without judgment or hurry.</p>

    <p>This is your space to explore whatever’s on your mind — whether it’s big, small, clear, or complicated. There’s no pressure to have all the answers, and no rush to get things “right.” It’s about giving yourself time to feel, reflect, and breathe.</p>

    <p>Therapy is a conversation — a gentle journey to help you remember your voice and find your way. You’re not alone here.</p>

    <div class="closing-lines">
      <p>No need to be perfect.<br />
      No need to have it all figured out.<br />
      No need to apologise.</p>

      <p>Just take the first step, in your own time.</p>
