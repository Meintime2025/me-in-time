    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Maybe you're feeling stuck. Maybe you’re holding more than you can manage on your own. Maybe something's shifted — or maybe nothing has, and that’s part of the problem.</p>
    <p>Whatever brings you here, Me In Time is a space to pause and take stock.</p>
    <p>I'm Stuart Walker — a counsellor who offers time, space, and presence for people navigating the difficult bits of life. My approach is warm, grounded, and human. I don’t offer quick fixes, and I won’t pretend to have all the answers. But I’ll meet you with honesty, care, and curiosity.</p>
    <p>I believe therapy is a conversation. It’s a place to explore things you might not say anywhere else. To be heard — without being judged or rushed. To remember your voice. To make space for whatever you’ve been carrying.</p>
    <p>This work isn’t about getting it right. It’s about giving yourself time — to make sense, to feel, to breathe, to be.</p>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about me or how I work, you’re very welcome to explore the site — or get in touch when you’re ready.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="how">

    <h2>🧭 Coaching</h2>
    <p><strong>Support for When You’re Feeling Stuck, Lost, or Ready for Change</strong></p>
    <p>Sometimes, it’s not therapy that’s needed — it’s a space to reflect, refocus, and move forward with clarity. Coaching offers time and structure to help you reconnect with what matters and take practical steps toward where you want to be.</p>

    <h3>✨ Why Work With Me</h3>
    <p>Before becoming a psychotherapist, I spent many years in leadership and coaching roles across different industries — mentoring individuals, managing teams, and supporting people through life transitions. I saw how much people benefit from honest, grounded support.</p>

    <p>That experience now shapes the way I work as a coach. I understand the blocks that can show up — low confidence, career fatigue, self-doubt, overwhelm — and I know how powerful it can be to have someone alongside you who listens, reflects, and helps you get moving again.</p>

    <p>Coaching with me is practical and person-centred. It’s not about having all the answers — it’s about discovering yours.</p>

    <h3>🌱 What Coaching Can Help With</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Feeling stuck or lost in life</li>
      <li>Navigating change or transition</li>
      <li>Career reflection or job dissatisfaction</li>
      <li>Confidence, motivation, and self-belief</li>
      <li>Men’s mental health and identity work</li>
      <li>Reconnecting with what matters to you</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧡 My Approach</h3>
    <p>This is a space for honest conversation, reflection, and real progress — at your pace. Coaching with me blends my background in leadership and mentoring with deep listening, challenge when needed, and a strong belief in your potential.</p>

    <p>Sessions are held online via Google Meet and follow the same pricing as counselling:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>£50 per session</li>
      <li>£25 concessionary rate (subject to availability)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📞 Next Steps</h3>
    <p>If this sounds like what you’re looking for, I’d love to hear from you. You can reach out via <a href="mailto:stuart.meintime@gmail.com">email</a> or the <a href="#contact">contact form</a> to arrange a free, no-pressure chat.</p>
    <p>And if I’m not the right fit, that’s okay too — I’ll happily signpost you to someone who might be.</p>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What can I expect from the first session?</summary>
      <p>The first session is a chance for us to get to know each other. We'll explore what’s brought you to therapy, talk through any goals or hopes you may have, and give you space to ask any questions. It’s a gentle introduction — there’s no pressure to share anything you’re not ready to.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
      <p>Sessions cost £50. A concessionary rate of £25 is available for those who need it. Payment is usually made by bank transfer after each session.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I book a session?</summary>
      <p>You can book a session by filling out the contact form on this website or emailing me directly. I’ll get back to you promptly to arrange a time that works.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How long are sessions and how often will we meet?</summary>
      <p>Sessions are 50 minutes long. Most people come weekly, but we can agree together on what works best for you — some prefer fortnightly or a more flexible arrangement.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if I can’t afford therapy?</summary>
      <p>I understand that therapy is an investment, and it’s important that it feels manageable. If cost is a barrier, please feel free to talk to me about this — I offer a limited number of lower-cost spaces, and I may also be able to signpost you to other services.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is therapy confidential?</summary>
      <p>Yes, therapy is confidential. What you share stays between us, with a few legal and ethical exceptions — for example, if there’s a risk of serious harm, safeguarding concerns, or a legal requirement to disclose information. I’ll explain all of this clearly in our first session so you feel informed and safe.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What kinds of issues do you work with?</summary>
      <p>I work with a wide range of concerns, including anxiety, depression, grief and loss, trauma, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties, identity questions, men’s mental health, and more. If you're unsure whether I can help, please do get in touch — I'm happy to talk it through.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do I need to prepare or bring anything to sessions?</summary>
      <p>No preparation is needed. Just bring yourself. Therapy is your space, and we can take things at a pace that feels right for you.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do I know if therapy is right for me?</summary>
      <p>Many people feel uncertain at first. The best way to find out is to try a session and see how it feels. There’s no obligation to continue if it doesn’t feel like the right fit — this is your process.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if I don’t feel comfortable?</summary>
      <p>Feeling safe and heard is key to good therapy. If something doesn’t feel right, I encourage you to talk about it — it’s an important part of the process. I also know I may not be the right fit for everyone, and that’s okay. We can discuss this openly, and if needed, I can help signpost you to another therapist who may be a better match for you.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can sessions be held online or in person?</summary>
      <p>I offer sessions online and in person (depending on availability). We can discuss what suits you best when you get in touch.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What’s your cancellation policy?</summary>
      <p>I ask for 48 hours’ notice if you need to cancel or reschedule a session. Cancellations made with less notice may be charged at the full session fee, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you work with men, LGBTQ+ or neurodivergent clients?</summary>
      <p>Yes. My practice is inclusive and welcoming to people of all genders, identities, and backgrounds. I work with individuals from all walks of life and aim to create a space where you feel safe, seen, and respected.</p>
