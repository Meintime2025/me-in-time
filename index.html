      <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>
      <p>Me In Time started with a simple but often overlooked truth â€” that men need space too. Space to talk, reflect, and feel without pressure. For years, I saw how hard it can be for men to reach out, and how little space there is for honest, human support.</p>
      <p>This is a place to bring whateverâ€™s going on â€” whether itâ€™s stress, grief, feeling stuck, or not even knowing how to describe it. You donâ€™t need to have it all figured out. You donâ€™t need to be in crisis. You just need to start where you are.</p>
      <p>Although Me In Time began with a focus on menâ€™s mental health, I welcome anyone who connects with this way of working â€” calm, thoughtful, and grounded in real conversation.</p>

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m Stuart Walker â€” a counsellor and coach who believes in meeting you where you are. I work gently but honestly, with warmth, curiosity, and no judgment. Weâ€™ll go at your pace and build a space that feels safe enough to be real â€” whether that means talking things through, sitting in silence, or figuring out what you need as we go.</p>

      <h2>Services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counselling:</strong> A confidential, person-centred space to explore anxiety, grief, low self-worth, life changes, or the weight of things that are hard to name.</li>
        <li><strong>Coaching:</strong> A practical, reflective space to gain clarity, rebuild confidence, and take meaningful steps â€” especially useful if you're at a crossroads or feeling stuck.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible sessions:</strong> All sessions are held online, with a limited number of low-cost places available. Weâ€™ll work together to find what suits you best.</li>
