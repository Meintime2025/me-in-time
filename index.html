  <h1>Welcome to Me In Time</h1>
<h1>Counselling & Psychotherapy in Manchester & Online</h1>
  <p>Maybe you're feeling stuck. Maybe you’re holding more than you can manage on your own. Maybe something's shifted — or maybe nothing has, and that’s part of the problem.</p>

  <p>Whatever brings you here, Me In Time is a space to pause and take stock.</p>

  <p>I'm Stuart Walker — a therapist who offers time, space, and presence for people navigating the difficult bits of life. My approach is warm, grounded, and human. I don’t offer quick fixes, and I won’t pretend to have all the answers. But I’ll meet you with honesty, care, and curiosity.</p>

  <p>I believe therapy is a conversation. It’s a place to explore things you might not say anywhere else. To be heard — without being judged or rushed. To remember your voice. To make space for whatever you’ve been carrying.</p>

  <p>This work isn’t about getting it right. It’s about giving yourself time — to make sense, to feel, to breathe, to be.</p>

  <div class="closing-lines">
    <p>No need to be polished.<br />
    No need to be strong.<br />
    No need to be sorry.</p>

    <p>Just begin.</p>
